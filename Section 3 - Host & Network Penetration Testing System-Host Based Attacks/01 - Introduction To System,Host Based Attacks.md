- System/Host based attacks are attacks that are **targeted towards a specific system or host running a specific operating system**, for example, Windows or Linux.

- Network services are **not the only attack vector that can be targeted** during a penetration test.

- System/Host based attacks usually come in to play after you have gained access to a target network, whereby, you will be required to exploit servers, workstations or laptops on the internal network.

- System/Host based attacks are primarily focused on **exploiting inherent vulnerabilities on the target OS.**

- Unlike network based attacks, host based attacks are much more **specialized and require an understanding of the target operating system** and the vulnerabilities that affect said operating systems.

- System/Host based attacks **involve exploiting misconfigurations and inherent vulnerabilities** within the target OS.
